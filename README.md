# Webot-AutoDrive-MazeBot

Webot-MazeSolver is an open-source project that focuses on developing an autonomous driving car capable of navigating through mazes in a simulated environment using the Webot platform. It utilizes the PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap) path planning algorithm and a geometric tracking-based point-to-point path following algorithm to find the optimal path through the maze.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation of a car in a maze using the Webot simulation environment
- Path planning using the PRM algorithm
- Point-to-point path following based on geometric tracking
- Import and display of maze maps
- First Prize (1st/109) in Introduction to Robotics
